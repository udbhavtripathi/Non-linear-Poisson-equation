# Non-linear-Poisson-equation
In this project, I have used FEniCS to find out the approximate solution of the Non-Linear Poisson's equation. 
I solved this equation over a square of unit dimension and discretize it into 128 triangular elements. 
Then I set it into a variational problem and defined boundary conditions and finally computed the solutions.
